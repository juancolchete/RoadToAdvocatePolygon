I started a course on my channel called [from scratch to generative art](https://t.ly/4pevV), that teaches step by step how you can create a collection of NFTs. First I teach how to curate each asset, and configure the project. The engine used to generate random NFTs is based on Hashlips. All personalization were made in live and available on this  [repository](https://t.ly/HQLkH). The [smart contract](https://t.ly/3X4Zy) is based on ERC-721 with customizations that allows: change metadata URI base, get mint price, buy NFTs, define a price and mint limit  The NFTs were deployed, minted and verified on [Polygon zK EVM Tesnet](https://t.ly/cebuW) to test the solidity version, [Mumbai](https://t.ly/ENZvx) to see NFTs on Open Sea and [Polygon zK EVM](https://t.ly/St92y) to teach how to deploy the collection on mainnet.

For developers that wants to go deeper on ERCs. I created a course called [Learning with Wizard](https://t.ly/1UdvQ) that explain what is [ERC-20](https://t.ly/xDJ4m), [ERC-721](https://t.ly/Q-08m), [ERC-1155](https://t.ly/PuPve), and its implementation, the main objective is to explain every important code on Open Zeppelin libraries.

With the objective to do an learning path from zero to hero to master on smart contracts development. I started a free course on  [youtube](https://t.ly/hqrP6) teaching solidity, best syntax, semantic, practices and most used standards and protocols, all the code can be found on [blockchain development repository](https://t.ly/G3IYa).

Is important to develop smart contracts, but I saw that know how a blockchain works is a good theme to improve your development skills and I created a course on  [youtube](https://t.ly/cmxN2) which explains about creating a blockchain using Substrate and deploy smart contracts on it, verify smart contracts, make this chain EVM, configure the substrate and related topics. All the code is available on [Blockchain Builder repository](https://t.ly/Fvgvc).

To generate value to blockchain community in general, I have opensource projects that teaches: about [Solidity Course](https://t.ly/Kzs2T), [Solidity to Portuguese Speakers](https://t.ly/Rg2gi), [Solidity Samples](https://t.ly/2fRMN), [JavaScript data structures and algorithms](https://t.ly/BQSj8).     

To bring accessibility and simplify learn about Blockchain world I have a [youtube channel](https://t.ly/J8rC8), its focus is teach to everyone who wants to become a developer that knows:  [NFT creation process from scratch to collection](https://t.ly/mV8M4), [JavaScript](https://t.ly/m7Nud), [IDE configuration, shortcuts and productivity tips](https://t.ly/lYgV_).

The [Furniture Degen](https://t.ly/HQLkH) is a project, which uses generative art to generate collection of NFTs. based on layers, each image has the same size and each layer has an z index to be able to assembly all of then and generate a image, all metadata is generated based in generation time, layer names and collection name and description. Images are stored on IPFS after generating, and after updating the metadata, these JSON files are also uploaded to IPFS.  The engine used to generate random NFTs is based on Hashlips. The [smart contract](https://t.ly/3X4Zy) is based on ERC-721 with customizations that allows: change metadata URI base, get mint price, buy NFTs, define a price and mint limit  The NFTs were deployed, minted and verified on [Polygon zK EVM Tesnet](https://t.ly/cebuW) to test the solidity version, [Mumbai](https://t.ly/ENZvx) to see NFTs on Open Sea and [Polygon zK EVM](https://t.ly/St92y) to teach how to deploy the collection on mainnet.
